                <p>
                    I'm a programmer with a strong interest in{" "}
                    <span className="bold">software development</span>. I have
                    experience with Python, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and
                    various databases. I have a passion for full-stack web
                    development, working with data pipelines, and exploring how
                    AI can enhance the way we interact with technology. I'm
                    constantly learning new technologies to expand my skillset.
                    <br />
                    <br />I grew up in Union City, California, a small town in
                    the SF Bay Area. My love for coding started in high school
                    when I first learned to code in Python and make basic user
                    interfaces with HTML/CSS/JS. This passion for building
                    followed me into college. I'm currently an undergraduate
                    student in my final year of a CS and engineering dual-degree
                    with Columbia University and Scripps College respectively.

                    Outside of coding, I enjoy{" "}
